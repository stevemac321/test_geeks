/*
Insertion Sort
arr: [6, 8, 10, 1, 9]
assumtion: arr len > 0
left = 0, right = 1

General algorithm:
left iterates arr until arr.len - 1
in each iteration of left, right iterates each element to the right
of left while arr[right] < arr.len.
at each of right's visit of an element, that element is moved into its 
proper place in the sorted partition of the array. To start, arr[0] is the
"sorted" partition.

so in the case given above: arr: [6, 8, 10, 1, 9] with left = 0, 
right - 1,left stays at 0, while right iterates and does not have to
move an element until arr[3] = 1.  

Then while a[right] < arr[right-1] && right > 0, swap arr[right] 
with arr[right-1]

Iterate left and repeat while left < arr.len
-----------------------------------------------------
Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
Hereâ€™s the general algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the first element of the array.

2. **Comparisons and Swaps**:
   - Compare the current element with the next element.
   - If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.

3. **Iterative Process**:
   - Move to the next element and repeat the comparison and swapping process.
   - Continue this process for each element in the array.

4. **Passes**:
   - After completing one full pass through the array, the largest element is 
   guaranteed to be at the end of the array.
   - Repeat the process for the remaining elements, excluding the last element
    which is already sorted.

5. **Termination**:
   - Continue making passes through the array until no swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.

### Key Points:
- **Multiple Passes**: The algorithm requires multiple passes through the array.
- **Adjacent Comparisons**: It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if necessary.
- **Gradual Sorting**: With each pass, the next largest element is bubbled to its 
correct position at the end of the array.
- **Inefficient for Large Data Sets**: Bubble sort is not suitable for large 
datasets as its average and worst-case complexity are both \(O(n^2)\).

### Efficiency:
- **Best Case**: \(O(n)\) when the array is already sorted.
- **Average and Worst Case**: \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops required for comparisons and swaps.
